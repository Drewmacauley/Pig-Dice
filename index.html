      <h2>Lets play some Pig Dice!</h2>
      <h3>You and your opponent will roll the dice until either player clicks "hold", or until somebody rolls a one. If somebody rolls a one, their score for the turn is reset, and their turn and it's the other player's turn. Any other number rolled will get added to the score total of that player. Once a person rolls and hits "hold", it becomes other person's turn. Game ends when a player scores one hundred points.  </h3>
